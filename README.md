# YAWT---Yet-Another-Watering-Timer

In my house by the sea, I have an irregularly shaped garden. The water available (from the consortium well) has a limited flow rate: it is necessary to divide the irrigation into numerous areas, to be activated in sequence. So I make two timers to handle 8 zones.

Each timer manages 4 zones: with 'smartLife' or with 'tuyaDeamon' I can program the intervention times and the weekly schedule per zone, getting full control from anywhere.

At the same time, in local, a remote control allows me to start and stop the irrigation of each zone at any time.
